#
# spooftest.py version v1.2
# USAGE:
# server# chmod a+x spooftest.py
# server# ./spooftest.py <dest server> <num of packets to send>
#
#
# This is a small, simple script to test your server's abilities to spoof IPv4 packets or not.
# You should use this instead of things like caida project's tool, because they're rumored to
# collect data or hand it off to others who harass the server/network owners until they re-configure
# their networks and discontinue allowing spoofed packets.
#
# By default, this script sends spoofed packets to fuzzme.packet.tel - but it can be configured to
# send them anywhere. You can download a constantly running pcap by typing:
# wget http://fuzzme.packet.tel/fuzzme.packet.tel.last10minutes.pcap
# EDIT: packet.tel has been killed off for now, and also I think cock.li (my host) may be in some hot water,
# sooooo yeah. No fun utilities like fuzzme for now.
#
# Thank the White Knights of the Internet for all of this crap.
#
# Requires scapy and a spoofy box
#
# TO DO:
# - Remove sys calls because theyre lame
# - Fix the code to make it less suck.
# - Remove all references to old code which used hardcoded values.
# - Fix up the interface and arg checks to use argparse instead of sys calls.
# - Other misc cleanups.
#
#
# Enjoy!
